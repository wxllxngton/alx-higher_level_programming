## 0x03-python-data_structures

**0-print_list_integer.py:**

This file contains a function named print_list_integer that takes a list of integers as input and prints each integer on a new line.

**1-element_at.py:**

This file contains a function named element_at that takes a list and an index as input and returns the element at the specified index. If the index is negative or out of range, the function returns None.

**10-divisible_by_2.py:**

This file contains a function named divisible_by_2 that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list. The new list contains True or False values, indicating whether each integer in the original list is divisible by 2.

**100-print_python_list_info.c:

This file is a C source code file that defines a function named print_python_list_info. This function takes a Python object (PyObject*) representing a list as input and prints some basic information about the list, such as its size, allocated memory, and elements.

**11-delete_at.py:**

This file contains a function named delete_at that takes a list and an index as input. It removes the element at the specified index from the list and returns the modified list. If the index is negative or out of range, the function returns the original list without any modifications.

**12-switch.py:**

This file contains a function named switch that takes two variables (a and b) as input and swaps their values using a temporary variable.

**2-replace_in_list.py:**

This file contains a function named replace_in_list that takes a list, an index, and an element as input. It replaces the element at the specified index in the list with the new element and returns the modified list.

**3-print_reversed_list_integer.py:**

This file contains a function named print_reversed_list_integer that takes a list of integers as input and prints each integer in reverse order on a new line.

**4-new_in_list.py:**

This file contains a function named new_in_list that takes a list, an index, and an element as input. It creates a new list by replacing the element at the specified index in the original list with the new element, without modifying the original list. The function returns the new list.

**5-no_c.py:**

This file contains a function named no_c that takes a string as input and returns a new string. The new string is the same as the original string, but with all occurrences of the letter 'c' (both uppercase and lowercase) removed.

**6-print_matrix_integer.py:**

This file contains a function named print_matrix_integer that takes a matrix (a list of lists) containing integers as input. The function prints the integers in the matrix in a specific format, where each row of the matrix is printed on a new line, and the integers within each row are separated by a space.

**7-add_tuple.py:**

This file contains a function named add_tuple that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple. The new tuple contains the element-wise addition of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

**8-multiple_returns.py:**

This file contains a function named multiple_returns that takes a sentence (string) as input. The function returns a tuple containing two elements: the length of the sentence and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character is None.

**9-max_integer.py:**

This file contains a function named max_integer that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value from the list. If the list is
