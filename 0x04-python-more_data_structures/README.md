## 0x04-python-more_data_structures

**0-square_matrix_simple.py:**

This file contains a function named square_matrix_simple that takes a matrix (a list of lists) of integers as input and returns a new matrix where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original matrix.

**1-search_replace.py:**

This file contains a function named search_replace that takes a list of integers and two integers (search and replace) as input. It replaces all occurrences of the search integer with the replace integer in the given list.

**10-best_score.py:**

This file contains a function named best_score that takes a dictionary as input. It searches for the highest value in the dictionary and returns the corresponding key (i.e., the key associated with the best score).

**100-weight_average.py:**

This file contains a function named weight_average that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a pair of values (score, weight). It calculates the weighted average of the scores using the corresponding weights and returns the result.

**101-square_matrix_map.py:**

This file contains a function named square_matrix_map that takes a matrix (a list of lists) of integers as input and returns a new matrix where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the original matrix. It uses the map function to apply the square operation.

**102-complex_delete.py:**

This file contains a function named complex_delete that takes a dictionary, a search value, and a size value as input. It deletes all elements from the dictionary whose value matches the search value and whose key length is equal to the size value.

**11-multiply_list_map.py:**

This file contains a function named multiply_list_map that takes a list of integers and a multiplier as input. It multiplies each element in the list by the multiplier using the map function and returns the resulting list.

**12-roman_to_int.py:**

This file contains a function named roman_to_int that takes a Roman numeral (a string) as input and converts it to an integer using the Roman numeral system.

**2-uniq_add.py:**

This file contains a function named uniq_add that takes a list of integers as input. It adds up all the unique integers in the list and returns the sum.

**3-common_elements.py:**

This file contains a function named common_elements that takes two lists of integers as input. It finds and returns a new list that contains the common elements between the two input lists (i.e., the elements that appear in both lists).

**4-only_diff_elements.py:**

This file contains a function named only_diff_elements that takes two lists of integers as input. It finds and returns a new list that contains the elements that appear only in one of the input lists (i.e., the elements that are not common to both lists).

**5-number_keys.py:**

This file contains a function named number_keys that takes a dictionary as input. It returns the number of keys (i.e., the count of unique keys) in the dictionary.

**6-print_sorted_dictionary.py:**

This file contains a function named print_sorted_dictionary that takes a dictionary as input. It prints the keys of the dictionary in alphabetical order, followed by their corresponding values.

**7-update_dictionary.py:**

This file contains a function named update_dictionary that takes a dictionary, a key, and a value as input. It updates the dictionary by adding or modifying the given key-value pair.

**8-simple_delete.py:**

This file contains a function named simple_delete that takes a dictionary and a key as input. It deletes the given key and its associated value from the dictionary if the key exists.

**9-multiply_by_2.py:**

This file contains a function named multiply_by_2 that takes a dictionary with integer values as input. It multiplies each value in the dictionary by 2.

**103-python.c:**

This file contains C code with two functions: `print_python_list_info` and `print_python_bytes_info`. These functions print basic information about Python lists and Python bytes objects, respectively. They provide details such as size, allocated memory, and content. The functions likely utilize Python's C API to access the required information and format it for printing. The purpose is to aid in understanding and analyzing the properties and memory usage of lists and bytes objects.
